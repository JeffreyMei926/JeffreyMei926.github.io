# LASSO: Least Absolute Shrinkage Selection Operator

The lasso is an extension of ordinary least squares regression that has several unique properties. 
- variable selection
- improved prediction

$$RSS(\beta, \lambda) = (y - X\beta)^T (y - X\beta) + \lambda \|\beta\|$$

## Variable Selection
- soft-thresholding

## Improved Prediction
- bias-variance tradeoff

## Extensions
- variations on penalty term
- variations on application
  - splines
